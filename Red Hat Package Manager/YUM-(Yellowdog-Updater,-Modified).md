## **ðŸ“Œ YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)**

**YUM** is a powerful package manager used primarily in **RPM-based Linux distributions** such as **CentOS**, **RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)**, and **Fedora**. It simplifies software installation, updating, and removal by managing dependencies automatically. YUM uses repositories to fetch and install software packages, making it easier to maintain your system.

### **Key Features of YUM:**

1. **Dependency Resolution:**  
   YUM automatically resolves and installs any dependencies required by the packages you want to install. This ensures that all necessary libraries and tools are available for the software to function properly.

3. **Group Installations:**  
   YUM allows you to install a group of related packages in one go (e.g., a "development tools" group), saving time and ensuring consistency.

4. **Rollback Capability:**  
   YUM can revert to a previous package version if an update causes issues. This feature helps maintain system stability and ensures you can quickly recover from potential problems.
