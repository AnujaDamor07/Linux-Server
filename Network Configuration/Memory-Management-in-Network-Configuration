## **ðŸ“Œ 1. Checking Memory Usage with `free` Command**

The `free` command displays memory usage in the system, showing both available and used memory. It provides memory statistics in human-readable formats (KB, MB, GB, etc.).

---

### **Step 1: Display Memory Usage in a Human-Readable Format**

To display memory usage in a human-readable format (i.e., auto-convert to GB, MB, KB):

```bash
free -h
```

**Example Output:**
```bash
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           8.0Gi       3.1Gi       1.5Gi       0.3Gi       3.4Gi       4.2Gi
Swap:          2.0Gi       0.0Gi       2.0Gi
```

- **total**: Total memory available.
- **used**: Memory used by processes and cache.
- **free**: Memory that is not being used.
- **available**: Memory available for starting new processes without swapping.

---

### **Step 2: Display Memory Usage in Gigabytes**

To display memory usage in gigabytes:

```bash
free -g
```

---

### **Step 3: Display Memory Usage in Megabytes**

To display memory usage in megabytes:

```bash
free -m
```

### **Step 4: Display Memory Usage in Kilobytes**

To display memory usage in kilobytes:

```bash
free -k
```

---

## **ðŸ“Œ 2. Monitoring System Performance with `vmstat`**

The `vmstat` (virtual memory statistics) command provides detailed system performance statistics, including CPU, memory, and disk usage.

---

### **Step 1: Display CPU and Memory Usage Statistics**

To display CPU and memory usage statistics:

```bash
vmstat
```

**Example Output:**
```bash
procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- ----cpu----
 r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si  so   bi   bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
 0  0      0 123456  23456  45678    0   0    3    4   89   67  1  3 95  0  1
```

- `r`: Number of processes waiting for run time.
- `b`: Number of processes in uninterruptible sleep.
- `swpd`: Amount of swap space used.
- `free`: Free memory.
- `buff`: Memory used as buffers.
- `cache`: Memory used as cache.
- `si`: Memory swapped in from disk (swap-in).
- `so`: Memory swapped out to disk (swap-out).
- `bi`: Blocks received from a block device (disk).
- `bo`: Blocks sent to a block device (disk).
- `in`: Number of interrupts per second.
- `cs`: Number of context switches per second.
- `us`: Percentage of CPU time spent in user space.
- `sy`: Percentage of CPU time spent in kernel space.
- `id`: Percentage of CPU time spent idle.
- `wa`: Percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O.
- `st`: Percentage of CPU time stolen by virtual machines.

---

### **Step 5: Continuous Monitoring with `vmstat`**

To continuously monitor system performance and display 5 reports every 4 seconds:

```bash
vmstat 4 5
```

- `4`: The interval (in seconds) between each report.
- `5`: The number of reports.

---

### **Step 6: Continuous Monitoring in Megabytes**

To continuously monitor system performance and display 5 reports every 4 seconds in megabytes:

```bash
vmstat -S M 4 5
```

---

### **Step 7: Include Timestamps in the Output**

To display continuous reports with timestamps, use:

```bash
vmstat -t 4 5 -S M
```

### **Step 1: Install `iostat` (If Not Installed)**

If `iostat` is not available, you can install it using:

```bash
yum install sysstat
```

---

### **Step 2: Display CPU and Disk Performance Statistics**

To display CPU and disk performance statistics:

```bash
iostat
```

**Example Output:**
```bash
