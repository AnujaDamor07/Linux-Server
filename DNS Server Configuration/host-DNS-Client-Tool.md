### **Basic `host` Commands**

#### **1. Lookup a Domain's IP Address**
- To find the IP address of a domain, use the following command:
  ```bash
  host google.com
  ```
  This will return the IP address associated with the domain `google.com`.

#### **2. Query Specific DNS Record Types**

##### **NS Record (Name Server)**
- To query the **Name Server (NS)** for a domain, use the following command:
  ```bash
  host -t ns google.com
  ```
  This will return the authoritative name servers for the domain `google.com`.

##### **MX Record (Mail Exchange)**
- To query the **Mail Exchange (MX)** servers for a domain, use this command:
  ```bash
  host -t mx google.com
  ```
  This will return the mail servers associated with the domain `google.com`.

##### **TXT Record (Text)**
- To query **TXT records** for a domain (e.g., SPF, DKIM), use the following command:
  ```bash
  host -t txt google.com
  ```
  This will return any TXT records associated with the domain `google.com`.

##### **SOA Record (Start of Authority)**
- To query the **SOA (Start of Authority)** record for a domain, use the following command:
  ```bash
  host -t soa google.com
  ```
  The SOA record contains information about the domain's primary nameserver and other metadata such as the serial number, refresh time, and expiration time.
